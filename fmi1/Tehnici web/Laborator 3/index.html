		<h2>8-bit games</h2>
		<p>In the history of video games, the third generation of game consoles, commonly referred to as the 8-bit era,
			began
			on
			July 15, 1983, with the Japanese release of two systems: Nintendo's Family Computer (commonly abbreviated to
			Famicom)
			and Sega's SG-1000. This generation marked the end of the video game crash of 1983, and a shift in the dominance
			of
			home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan. The best-selling console of this generation was the
			NES/Famicom from Nintendo, followed by the Sega Master System (the improved successor to the SG-1000), and the
			Atari
			7800. Although the previous generation of consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of the third
			generation that home consoles were first labeled and marketed by their "bits".</p>
		<p>Here are some of the most popular games of that generation:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="mario.html">Mario Bros</a></li>
			<li>Legend Of Zelda</li>
			<li>Castlevania</li>
			<li>Final Fantasy</li>
			<li>Tetris</li>
			<li>Dragon Ball: Dragon Daihikyō</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Programming for NES</h3>
		<p>NES was shipped with only 4 KB of RAM, but "mapper" hardware on the cartridge expanded its capabilities,
			supporting
			games as large as 1 MB.</p>

		<p>Try programming for NES using the platform below provided by https://8bitworkshop.com/.</p>

		<h2>8-bit graphics</h2>
		<p>8-bit color graphics are a method of storing image information in a computer's memory or in an image file, so
			that
			each pixel is represented by 8 bits (1 byte). The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time
			is
			256 or 2^8.

			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<p>Because of the low amount of memory and resultant higher speeds of 8-bit color images, 8-bit color was a common
			ground among computer graphics development until more memory and higher CPU speeds became readily available to
			consumers. 8-bit color was used in many different applications including:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The MSX2 series of personal computer
			</li>
			<li>
				The Atari Falcon
			</li>
			<li>
				Wearable OS smartwatches with ambient displays
			</li>
			<li>
				Many scanners use an 8-bit grey scale as their standard
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>8-bit music</h2>
		<p>
			Chiptune (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune), also known as chip music or 8-bit music, is a style of
			synthesized electronic music made using the programmable sound generator sound chips or synthesizers in vintage
			arcade machines, computers and video game consoles. The term is commonly used to refer to tracker format music
			which intentionally sounds similar to older PSG-created music (this is the original meaning of the term), as well
			as music that combines PSG sounds with modern musical styles. It has been described as "an interpretation of many
			genres" since any existing song can be arranged in a chiptune style defined more by choice of instrument and
			timbre than specific style elements.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Technology
		</h3>
		<p>
			A waveform generator is a fundamental module in a sound synthesis system. A waveform generator usually produces a
			basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator
			configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator.
			Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square
			wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing
			only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and
			contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology were the Nintendo Game
			Boy portable game console and the Commodore 64 personal computer.
